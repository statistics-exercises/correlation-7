# Generating pairs of random variables

If you press run on this exercise now you will again a new tab appears called `joint_uniform.png`.  You will, once again, see a graph with a box if you click on this tab.  Now, however the box has another different shape and position.  Your task to modify the code that you just wrote to generate 100 randomly chosen points so that they now fall within the region of the xy-plane that is highlighted in this new figure.  The x-coordinates of these 100 points should be put within the list called `xdata`, while the y-coordinates of these points should be put within the list called `ydata`. 

For this task in particular you should generate 100 random points (x,y).  For each of these points -2.6 < x < 3.9 and 1 < y < 8.   You should not need to use an if statement to complete this exercise.
